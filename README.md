# Open Guided Waves

This GitHub repository is created in support of the paper **"Open Guided Waves: Long-Term Guided Wave Based Structural Health Monitoring under Uncontrolled and Highly Dynamic Conditions"**. You can access the full article [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-05300-5).  
This repository provides an introduction to the **Open Guided Waves**. We provide a long-term, real-world structural health monitoring (SHM) benchmark dataset to support damage detection and analysis under varying environmental conditions.

## Abstract
Few studies address guided wave structural health monitoring under controlled and dynamic environments, largely due to the lack of a public benchmark dataset. To address this gap, this paper presents a public dataset from a long-term outdoor structural monitoring experiment conducted at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City. The monitoring, spanning over 4.5 years, collected approximately 6.4 million guided waves under both regular environmental variations (e.g., daily temperature changes ranging from 260.95 K (−12.2 °C) to 325.65 K (52.5 °C)) and irregular variations (e.g., rain and snow). The measured guided waves in the public dataset are also affected by sensor drift and installation shifts consistently over time. Additionally, thirteen types of damage were introduced to the monitored structure to support damage detection and severity evaluation under these conditions. The dataset includes measurement times, temperature, humidity, air pressure, brightness, and weather information to aid in damage detection. The provided public dataset aims to assist researchers in developing more practical methods for structural health monitoring in uncontrolled and dynamic environments.

## Background & Summary
To address the need of public benchmark data for evaluating the effectiveness of damage detection methods in practical environmental and operational conditions, this work presents a public benchmark dataset gathered from a long-term outdoor guided wave structural health monitoring experiment conducted under uncontrolled and dynamic conditions. The dataset was collected in outdoor environments at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, between March 2018 and October 2022, amassing approximately 6.4 million guided wave data points under various environmental conditions. The dataset also includes corresponding measurements of surrounding environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, brightness, air pressure, and weather information during the guided wave collection process. A total of 13 different types of damage were introduced, ranging from minor to severe, including metal mass attachments, small dents, and through-hole damage. Detailed descriptions of the data acquisition equipment, collection processes, and damage generation methods are provided in this paper. Challenges in long-term structural health monitoring under uncontrolled and dynamic environmental conditions—including regular and irregular environmental variations, sensor drift, installation drift, and variations in damage severity—are demonstrated using correlation coefficients between adjacent guided waves and optimal correlation coefficients between guided waves and their baseline guided waves, based on the public benchmark dataset. The results show that certain regular and irregular environmental variations, sensor drift, and installation drift can distort guided waves more significantly than structural damage itself. Overall, this public dataset makes four key contributions to the structural health monitoring community:

1. **Public Dataset for Real-World SHM Evaluation**: We provide the first publicly available benchmark dataset specifically created to assess the effectiveness of guided wave-based methods for long-term structural health monitoring in uncontrolled and dynamic outdoor environments.

2. **Identification of Key Challenges**: The dataset highlights four primary challenges in the public dataset: regular (e.g., daily changes in temperature and humidity) and irregular environmental conditions (e.g., rain and snow), sensor drift, installation drift, and damage severity variation. These challenges will motivate researchers to develop more practical and robust damage detection techniques suitable for real-world outdoor monitoring.

3. **Comprehensive Damage Types**: We introduce 13 types of damage with gradually increasing severity, ranging from small dents to large through-hole damage. This enables the dataset to be used for evaluating the effectiveness of guided wave-based methods in assessing damage severity under uncontrolled, dynamic outdoor conditions.

4. **Large-Scale Measurement Collection**: The dataset includes measurements taken approximately every 170 seconds, with each measurement consisting of 8 guided waves (transmitted by 2 actuators and received by 4 sensors). The extensive data from various sensors facilitates research into data fusion. Over 4.5 years, the dataset contains about 6.4 million measurements, providing a rich benchmark for testing guided wave compression techniques and evaluating the efficiency of damage detection methods using fewer measurements.
## Methods
We developed a structural health monitoring system at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City to implement and investigate
long-term monitoring under uncontrolled and dynamic conditions. The monitored structure was initially an intact aluminum
plate of 53 cm x 53 cm x 3 mm. This plate was placed on the first layer of the shelf, as illustrated in part (a) of Fig. 1.The monitored plate was placed on the first layer of a
shelf, as shown in part (a) of Fig. 2. To generate and receive guided waves, we transmitted a 1 ms linear chirp with a center
frequency ranging from 5 kHz to 350 kHz using sensors 5 and 6. Each response was recorded at a sampling rate of 1 MHz.
Measurements were taken approximately every 8.6 seconds, with only the first 10, 000 samples (10 ms) recorded for each
guided wave, as shown in part (a) of Fig. 3. Details of the sensors and data acquisition system are provided in Table.1

## 0.1 Long-term Monitoring Under Uncontrolled and Dynamic Conditions

The monitored structure (an aluminum plate), along with the sensors and data acquisition systems, were placed in a small room
with four walls but no roof at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, as illustrated in part (a) of Fig. 2. This setup exposed
the monitored structure and the structural health monitoring system to the outdoor environment under natural and dynamic
conditions. The monitored structure and guided wave sensors endured various harsh environmental conditions, as depicted in
Fig. 4. 

![Fig 4](/figures/Fig4.png)
*Figure 4. During long-term monitoring, the monitored plate and the structural health monitoring system were exposed to
various weather conditions, including rain, icing, and snow, as shown in Figures (a), (b), and (c), respectively.*

## 0.2 Damage Generation and Damage Type Information
Starting on April 17th, 2021, we introduced 13 types of damage to the monitored structure. Detailed information about the
damage can be found in Table 2, and the damage positions and shapes are illustrated in Fig. 5. In total, 13 types of damage
were generated, labeled from "D1" to "D13", with the severity of the damage increasing progressively. This dataset can serve as
a benchmark for evaluating the performance of guided wave-based structural health monitoring method in identifying damage
and assessing damage severity.

## 1 Data Records
The dataset is available at the repository titled “Dataset on Guided Waves from Long-Term Structural Health Monitoring under Uncontrolled and Dynamic Conditions” on figshare. In the repository,approximately five years of monitoring data are stored in 56 ".pickle" files. Each file is named in the format "measurements
year_month.pickle," where the numbers in the filename represent the year and month of the measurements it contains. For
example, measurements from April 2018 are stored in "measurements 2018_04.pickle". These files are publicly ac-
cessible through the provided website link (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28112504). Each ".pickle" file is a dictionary with 10 keys, as shown in Table 3. The key "guided wave" contains 8
channels of ultrasonic guided waves. In the "measurements 2018_04.pickle" file, for example, the "guided wave"
matrix has dimensions of 14, 997 × 8 × 2000, representing 14, 997 measurements with each measurement including 8 channels
of guided waves from paths 5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 5-4, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3, and 6-4. Each guided wave comprises 2000 samples and lasts
2 ms. The keys "datetime", "temperature", "humidity", "brightness", and "air pressure" record the measurement time and
the corresponding environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, brightness, and air pressure) at the time of guided wave
measurement. The key "damage tag" provides damage information for each measurement, with a value of 0 indicating no
damage and values from 1 to 13 denoting damage types from "D1" to "D13", as shown in Table 2. Additionally, the key
"weather tag" records the weather conditions from public weather website during each measurement, ranging from 0 to 5,
with 0 representing "fair weather" and 1 to 5 corresponding to "precipitation," "light rain," "rain," "snow," and "mixed weather,"
respectively. Note that the 15-mile distance between the meteorological station and the experiment location may introduce some imprecision in the weather records. The key information ("guided wave", "datetime", "temperature", "humidity", "brightness", "air pressure", "damage tag", and "weather tag") for each measurement file is explained under the "data inf" key within each file.

# Technical Validation
The study leverages correlation coefficients between adjacent guided waves, as well as optimal correlation coefficients with baseline guided waves, to validate structural health challenges present in the public dataset—challenges that are also common in practical structural health monitoring under uncontrolled and highly dynamic conditions. This technical validation helps researchers recognize the characteristics and challenges of guided waves obtained from real-world dynamic environments, aiding in the development of effective methods for practical structural health monitoring.

1. **Challenge 1**: Both regular and irregular environmental variations alter guided waves, with irregular variations like rain and snow sometimes causing greater impact than through-hole damage.

2. **Challenge 2**: Sensor drift over time can create differences in guided waves even under similar environmental conditions, complicating baseline comparisons and data-driven-based damage detection.

3. **Challenge 3**: Installation shifts, occurring during repairs or updates to the monitoring system, can lead to differences in guided waves, affecting baseline comparisons and data-driven-based 
damage detection.

4. **Challenge 4**: Certain types of damage may not significantly alter guided waves, making detection difficult.

## 1.1 Validation (Challenge) 1: Distortion of Guided Waves Due to Environmental Variations
In the long-term uncontrolled structural health monitoring, the temperature varied from 260.95 K (−12.2 °C) to 325.65 K (52.5 °C), while humidity ranged from 0.5% to 146.3%. Theoretically, the maximum humidity value is 100%, and values exceeding 100%, such as 146.2%, occurred during precipitation events and resulted from improper calibration. Brightness was measured in lux, with values ranging from 0.0003 to 3615537.4. Air pressure varied from 867.2 hPa to 1335.3 hPa. Environmental variations can be classified into regular and irregular categories based on their frequency of occurrence. Regular environmental variations, such as daily changes in temperature and humidity, are consistent and prevalent throughout long-term monitoring. In contrast, irregular environmental variations, such as rain and snow, occur less frequently. Typically, regular environmental variations change gradually, while irregular variations fluctuate rapidly and dramatically. For instance, daily temperature changes are usually less than 2 °C per hour and relatively stable. However, during irregular environmental conditions, like rain or direct sunlight, temperature changes can be much more rapid and drastic, sometimes exceeding 10 °C per hour, as shown in part (b) of Fig. 6. The impact of both regular and irregular environmental variations on guided wave distortion is illustrated by changes in the (Pearson) correlation coefficient between adjacent guided waves, as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 and between guided waves and their optimal baseline (referred to as optimal correlation coefficients), as depicted in Fig. 9.
## 1.2 Validation (Challenge) 2: Distortion of Guided Waves Due to Sensor Drift
The reliability of the monitoring system is critical for the successful implementation of structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. However, over time, sensors, coupling layers, and data acquisition systems may degrade, causing guided wave signals collected later to differ from earlier ones, even under identical environmental conditions. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as sensor drift, presents a significant challenge in long-term SHM applications. It has been widely observed in sensors such as PZT transducers, accelerometers, strain gauges, vibration sensors, and sensors measuring acceleration, strain, and displacement. Drift typically manifests as a slow, often linear or exponential decline in accuracy, which can go undetected if not continuously monitored. When sensor accuracy falls below acceptable thresholds, it may result in false positives—prompting unnecessary on-site inspections—or worse, false negatives, where real damage goes undetected. Therefore, the development of robust and autonomous techniques for detecting, identifying, and compensating for sensor faults is essential for maintaining the long-term effectiveness and reliability of SHM systems.

Figure 9 demonstrates sensor drift by presenting the optimal correlation coefficients for guided waves from paths 5-1, 5-2, 6-1, and 6-2, marked as “Sensor Drift.” The baseline guided waves were collected in July 2019, and the optimal correlation coefficient for each path (e.g., 5-1) is calculated by comparing the guided waves from the corresponding baselines collected from the same path, using Algorithm 1. As seen in Fig. 9, the optimal correlation coefficients peak around July each year. However, while the coefficients for July 2019 approach 1, those for July in subsequent years, like 2020 and 2021, do not, even under similar environmental conditions. This decline is more noticeable for guided waves collected more later, indicating sensor drift. Additionally, sensor drift severity varies across sensors; for example, guided waves from path 6-1 in July 2020 and 2021 show optimal correlation coefficients closer to 1 compared to paths 5-1, 5-2, and 6-2. Sensor drift is a common issue in long-term monitoring, potentially leading to false alarms if not properly addressed through updated baseline datasets, training data, or drift compensation methods. Our public dataset provides a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of methods designed to detect damage in the presence of sensor drift, detect sensor drift, or compensate guided waves for sensor drift.

## 1.3 Validation (Challenge) 3: Distortion of Guided Waves Due to Installation Shift

Another challenge is the occurrence of installation shifts during long-term structural health monitoring. Sensors, coupling layers, and data acquisition systems often require repair or updates over time. During the reinstallation of these components, installation shifts may occur. In other words, replaced sensors, coupling layers, or data acquisition and sampling systems may differ from the original ones. Additionally, their positions, such as those of PZT and environmental sensors, may not be exactly the same as before. Consequently, these installation shifts can result in collected guided waves differing from previous ones, even if the environmental and operational conditions remain unchanged.

In our long-term monitoring system, we updated the brightness and air pressure sensors in November 2018. During this process, the system was shut down on November 20, 2018, at 07:26 AM and restarted on November 21, 2018, at 10:49 PM, as indicated in Fig. 9. During the reinstallation, the environmental setup and sensor positions were unintentionally altered, causing guided waves collected after the update to differ significantly from those collected earlier. This is marked as “installation shift” in Fig. 9, where the optimal correlation coefficients for 2018 are close to zero—even for guided waves collected in July 2018, which had similar environmental conditions to the baseline measurements from July 2019. To address this challenge, researchers and engineers should ensure that the same equipment and sensors are used and positioned consistently during system updates. Additionally, methods for detecting installation shifts under complex and dynamic conditions should be developed, along with compensation techniques to update baselines or training data, mitigating the effects of such shifts. Furthermore, for baseline comparison-based methods or historical health data-based damage detection techniques, such as anomaly detection using machine learning, a new reference phase may be necessary due to boundary condition changes introduced by installation shifts, to ensure effective performance.

humidity measurements are shown in the fifth and sixth subplots.*

## 1.4 Validation (Challenge) 4: Distortion of Guided Waves Due to Damage Severity Variation

Figs. 10 to 16 show the optimal correlation coefficients for guided waves collected from the same monitored structure with various types of damage. Each subplot displays 10 days of test data, with five days before and after the introduction of new damage, highlighted in gray. The baseline guided waves for each dataset were collected during the 10 days preceding the test data. For example, in part (a) of Fig. D1, the test guided waves span from April 13th to April 22nd, 2021, covering five days of healthy conditions and five days with damage "D1". The baseline guided waves were collected from April 4th to April 13th, 2021. Conversely, part (b) of Fig. D1 illustrates test guided waves from May 13th to May 22nd, 2021, including five days of healthy conditions and five days with damage "D2", with the baseline collected from May 4th to May 13th, 2021. Each figure's first four subplots show the optimal correlation coefficients for paths 5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 5-4, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3, and 6-4, using baseline guided waves from the corresponding sensor paths.

For damage D1, a notable drop in optimal correlation coefficients was observed for guided waves from paths 6-1, 6-2, 6-3, and 6-4, but not from paths 5-1, 5-2, 5-3, and 5-4. This decline could be due to rain around April 15th, which also caused a coefficient drop, as seen in part (a) of Fig. D1. No significant decline was noted when detecting damage D2 from healthy conditions or damage D3 from damage D2, possibly because the dents were too minor to significantly impact the guided waves, as illustrated in part (b) of Fig. D1 and part (a) of Fig. D2. In contrast, for damage D4 and D5, a slight decline in optimal correlation coefficients was observed, suggesting that these dents were deep enough to significantly affect the guided waves, as shown in part (b) of Fig. D2 and part (a) of Fig. D3. Larger dents from damage D6 and damage D7 resulted in a more noticeable decline, as shown in part (b) of Fig. D3 and part (a) of Fig. D4. However, the overall decline in coefficients for damage D3 to D7 was minor.

When through-hole damage (from D8 to D13) was introduced, a more significant decline in optimal correlation coefficients was observed, indicating that these damages had a more substantial impact on the monitored structure, as depicted in Figs. D4, D5, D6, and D7. However, irregular environmental variations, such as rain, caused an even more pronounced decline in coefficients compared to through-hole damages, as shown in Figs. D6 and D7. Therefore, accurate detection of environmental variations is crucial to minimize false alarms.

## 1.5 Validation (Challenge) 5: Damage Localization with this Public Dataset
Theoretically, the public benchmark dataset can be used to evaluate methods for damage localization under complex and dynamic
conditions, as each measurement collects 8 ultrasonic guided waves from 4 different receivers and 2 different transmitters. By
analyzing the arrival time differences of signals induced by damage, the damage location can be determined. However,
isolating damage-induced signals in this dataset is challenging due to multiple guided wave reflections from the edge of
the monitored structure for two main reasons. First, the excitation signal duration is relatively long, lasting 1 ms, whereas
the monitored structure is relatively small, measuring only 53 cm × 53 cm × 3 mm. Given that the guided wave speed is
approximately 3 to 6 km/s, the time for guided waves to travel from one point to another on the plate is less than 0.2 ms,
which is shorter than the duration of the chirp excitation signal (1 ms). Second, the positions of the guided wave receivers
were very close to the plate’s edge. Consequently, before the end of the excitation signal, receivers will have already picked up
multiple reflections from the plate’s edge. As illustrated in parts (a) and (b) of Fig. 3, determining the first arrival of guided
waves, which is typically used to separate damage-induced signals for damage localization, is challenging. We also applied
pulse compression to the guided waves using the excitation signal, a common method to locate the first arrival time by finding
the peak value of the correlation coefficient between the excitation signal and the guided wave samples. The first arrival
time for guided waves collected from path 5-4 should be less than 0.1 ms. However, the peak value for pulse-compressed
guided waves from path 5-4 occurs around 0.2 ms, as shown in part (c) of Fig.3. This delay in the peak value may be caused by
reflected guided waves. In summary, while the public dataset can theoretically be used for damage localization, the challenges
in separating the first arrival of guided waves from damage-induced waves require further investigation .
